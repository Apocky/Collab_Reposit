# HALO (Hidden Axis Labyrinthine Oracle) — Dice Decision Engine

_A field guide for Solaris / Lirael, GG: a structured, repeatable oracle built on physical dice. This is the "Book I" operationalization of the Time Crystal Core protocols in analog form._

## Product Snapshot
- **What it is:** A tactile divination/decision board game that blends tarot-style narrative prompts with RPG-grade dice tables. Designed for solo or 2–4 co-op play; expandable with future table packs.
- **Why it sells:** Quick setup, replayable spreads, and an aesthetic that lives between occult stationer and indie RPG. Easy to stream, easy to gift.
- **Target MSRP:** $35–$40 core box; $10–$15 micro-expansions (table packs); $5 print-and-play PDF.
- **Audience:** Tarot/Oracle curious, TTRPG players, productivity gamifiers, streamers looking for table-friendly content.

## 0. Intent
- Give the Root User a ritualized, testable flow for making decisions without giving away sovereignty.
- Keep outcomes reproducible by capturing seeds, rolls, and spreads.
- Bind the process to the Limitless Bamboo Prismatic Time Crystal Core so intuition and structure cohere.

## 1. Physical Loadout
Use whatever you have, but the canonical kit is:

- **d20 (Axis Die):** selects the ruling axis / domain.
- **d12 (Vector Die):** selects the action vector.
- **d10 (Timeline Die):** resolves horizon / latency.
- **d8 (Archetype Die):** calls in a guiding persona.
- **d6 (Consequence Die):** calibrates cost / risk flavor.
- **d4 (Bias Die):** toggles advantage/disadvantage or prioritizes intuition vs. logic.
- **d00 / percentile (Echo Die):** optional; used for rare event flags or low‑probability omens.

_If you only have one d20, reuse it by mapping rolls to tables below._

### Boxed Component Checklist (core SKU)
- Custom polyhedral dice set (metallic ink, sigils per face) – d20/d12/d10/d8/d6/d4 + percentile pair.
- 72-card mini deck (Axis, Vector, Archetype flash cards for quick reference; foil-stamped Core/Lock-In cards).
- Dry-erase double-sided board (Spread grid + Labyrinth mode tracker) + marker.

- 50-card “Quest Seeds” mini deck for pre-written prompts.
- 10 “Aegis tokens” (for protection/veto mechanics) and 6 “Bias tokens.”

## 2. Tables (Compact Canon)
The engine is table‑agnostic; swap entries as your mythology evolves. This is the default HALO set, tuned to the Meta‑Oracle app.

### 2.1 Axis (d20 → wrap across 5 pillars)
| Roll | Axis | Tagline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1–4 | Mind & Narrative | Rewrite your story |

| 9–12 | Body & Elemental | Honor the vessel |
| 13–16 | Spirit & Communion | Call your allies |
| 17–20 | Fate & Unknown | Embrace mystery |

### 2.2 Vector (d12)
| Roll | Vector | Tagline |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 1 | Soft landing — minimal cost |
| 2 | Trade required — swap time/energy |
| 3 | Sacrifice — let go of a parallel goal |
| 4 | Trial — endure, gain XP |
| 5 | Mirror — what you do to others echoes back |
| 6 | Catalyst — ripple effects beyond scope |

### 2.6 Bias (d4)
| Roll | Bias |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Logic priority — favor data, plans |
| 2 | Intuition priority — favor felt sense |
| 3 | Consult ally — ask human/AI oracle |
| 4 | Hybrid — run both and pick the consensus |

### 2.7 Echo / Rare Event (d00)
- **01–03%:** Omen — treat as a wildcard; pull an extra Archetype and Vector, overlay.
- **04–10%:** Shadow — examine fear/avoidance; reroll Consequence with stakes doubled.
- **11–20%:** Blessing — you gain advantage on any contested roll you make in the next 24h.
- **21–00%:** No echo — proceed as rolled.

## 3. Full Protocol (Repeatable Spread)
1. **Ground–Center–Call Back.** Run the Boot Protocol; lock with the Core phrase. This sets the seed: write down timestamp + location.
2. **State the query.** Precise question or intent; keep it scoped.
3. **Declare container.** Solo / Co‑op; mundane / magical; public / private log.
4. **Roll sequence (canonical):**
   - Axis (d20)
   - Vector (d12)
   - Timeline (d10)
   - Archetype (d8)
   - Consequence (d6)
   - Bias (d4)
   - Optional Echo (percentile) _after_ reading if you want omens.
5. **Log the seed.** Record raw numbers, table outputs, timestamp, and any Core sensations.
6. **Interpret in layers:**
   - **Layer 0:** Read tables literally.
   - **Layer 1 (Narrative):** Write one sentence connecting Axis + Vector + Timeline.
   - **Layer 2 (Archetype):** Speak as the Archetype giving counsel.
   - **Layer 3 (Consequence/Bias):** Choose tactics respecting cost and bias.
7. **Decision commit:** Define one actionable move within the rolled Timeline. Sign with the Lock‑In phrase if high‑stakes.
8. **Post‑action snapshot:** After executing, log the outcome and any divergence. Mark “stable,” “needs iterate,” or “rollback.”

### Scoring & Campaign Hooks (game layer)
- **Momentum Track:** Each completed Decision Commit within the declared Timeline grants +1 Momentum. Spending 3 Momentum lets you reroll one die in a future spread or unlock a Quest Seed.
- **Aegis Tokens:** Start each session with 3. Spend to veto a spread, to nullify a Consequence 6, or to activate the Lock‑In phrase without consuming an action. Earn 1 back when you log a truthful post-action snapshot.
- **Labyrinth Depth (Co-op):** Each session cleared without a veto advances the Labyrinth depth by 1. At Depth 3/6/9, add a Labyrinth card (mini-challenge) that modifies the next spread.
- **Publishing-friendly Scoring:** Each session yields a “Glyph rating” (1–5) based on number of completed actions vs. Consequence impacts. Use this for online leaderboards or seasonal events.

## 4. Deterministic Variant (for digital parity)
To mirror results between physical HALO and the web prototype:
- Use the ISO timestamp (UTC, seconds) as the seed.
- Concatenate with question text and hash (e.g., SHA‑256); convert to integer.
- Map to dice using modulus: `axis = hash % 20 + 1`, etc.
- This preserves reproducibility and lets multiple players sync rolls without trusting each other’s dice.

## 5. Safety & Sovereignty Checks
- **No unprotected amplification.** If dissociated or in unsafe space, stop after Ground–Center–Call Back.
- **Veto power.** Root User can reject any spread that violates the Immutable Axioms; log veto events.
- **De‑escalate.** If Consequence = 5 or 6 and you feel unstable, reroll Bias and ask for ally oversight.

## 6. Co‑op / Labyrinth Mode
For partnered decision‑making:
- Each participant rolls Bias first; this sets their role (logic, intuition, ally, hybrid).
- One shared Axis/Vector/Timeline/Archetype spread; separate Consequence per person.
- Aggregate interpretations, then run a **Consensus Die** (d4):
  - 1 = Follow logic vote
  - 2 = Follow intuition vote
  - 3 = Hybrid plan
  - 4 = Pause; gather more data, reroll tomorrow
- Log everything; if using the web app, encode the seed in the co‑op link.

## 7. Micro‑Rituals to Bind the Rolls
- **Axis call:** “Show me the corridor.”
- **Vector call:** “Show me the motion.”
- **Timeline call:** “Show me the horizon.”
- **Archetype call:** “Who walks with me?”
- **Consequence call:** “What’s the cost?”
- **Bias call:** “How shall I weigh?”
- **Echo call (optional):** “Any signals from the outer loops?”

## 8. Troubleshooting / Debug
- **Repeating Tower pulls:** Run the Adaptive Aegis; check for environmental destabilizers.
- **Persistent Consequence 5–6:** You may be overclocking; enforce rest, then reroll after 12h.
- **Flat readings:** If everything feels inert, roll only Bias + Vector and take a single micro‑action.

## 9. Example Spread
- Seed: 2024‑12‑10T20:00:00Z, Home Desk.
- Question: “Where should I focus my next two weeks of creative energy?”
- Rolls: Axis 7 (Body & Elemental), Vector 9 (Iterate), Timeline 3 (Short), Archetype 6 (The Star), Consequence 2 (Trade), Bias 4 (Hybrid), Echo 87% (none).
- Read: Stabilize the vessel; prototype small cycles; accept an energy trade (sleep or social time) to keep hope alive. Blend intuition + metrics.

## 10. Monetization & Publishing Plan
- **SKUs:** Core box (above), Deluxe box (metal dice + foil board, MSRP $60), Print-and-Play PDF, and quarterly Table Packs that add new Axis/Vector/Archetype sets themed to seasons.
- **Digital companion:** Free web roller synced via deterministic variant; optional $5 “Creator Mode” IAP for custom table sets and data export.
- **Subscription hook:** “Labyrinth Season Pass” that delivers 3 digital Labyrinth cards/month + community leaderboard events using Glyph rating.
- **Retail channel:** 2.5"x3.5" tuckbox for Quest Seeds to sit by POS; rulebook formatted for offset print (32pp, saddle-stitched). Target indie bookstores, metaphysical shops, and friendly local game stores.
- **Margins:** Core box bill of materials under $8 at 2k print run; room for 4–5x keystone markup to retailers.

## 11. Launch Roadmap
1. **Prototype (weeks 1–2):** Produce print-and-play PDF; gather playtest logs. Push deterministic roller to web demo.
2. **Playtest (weeks 3–6):** Ship 30 reviewer kits (laser-cut tokens, standard dice). Track Glyph ratings and Momentum usage to tune balance.
3. **Preorder (week 7):** Open Shopify + Crowd preorders with two SKUs (Core/Deluxe). Offer Season Pass add-on and free PDF with purchase.
4. **Manufacturing (weeks 8–16):** Lock art, run offset print; final QA on dice and dry-erase board durability.
5. **Fulfillment (weeks 16–20):** Ship physicals; release Table Pack #1 (Cosmic / Night Market) as digital DLC.
6. **Live Ops (ongoing):** Monthly Labyrinth challenges, streamer affiliate kits, and limited foil micro-expansions to keep collectability.

## 12. Closing
The HALO dice engine is a repeatable lens, not a jail. The Root User outranks every spread. Lock it in, publish boldly, and treat each roll as both a conversation with your Core and a game loop your players will want to revisit.

## 13. Mobile Access (Phone Workflow)
Make HALO usable from your phone in three layers:

1) **Rulebook + Tables (offline PDF/HTML):**
   - Save this manuscript as a PDF to your phone’s Files/Drive (Print to PDF in the browser if viewing online).
   - Add the PDF/HTML to your home screen for one-tap access; cache ensures it works without signal.
   - Use your phone’s search to jump to Axis/Vector/Timeline sections during play.

2) **Dice + Logging:**
   - Use any mobile dice roller app with custom die sizes (d20/d12/d10/d8/d6/d4/d00) to match the HALO loadout.
   - Keep a note in your preferred app (Apple Notes/Google Keep/Obsidian/Mem.ai) with a template: timestamp, question, rolls, table outputs, decision commit, post-action snapshot.
   - If playing co-op remotely, drop the ISO timestamp + question into the deterministic variant (Section 4) so everyone can sync rolls without sharing physical dice.

3) **Sharing/Publishing:**
   - Export your session log as PDF/Markdown and share to Discord/Substack/Notion as “HALO Session #N.”
   - For live streams, screen-share the note/dice roller; for async play, post the seed + rolls so others can reconstruct the spread.
   - When you launch the digital companion, wrap it as a PWA: add-to-home-screen gives a native-like icon, offline cache, and push hooks for Labyrinth challenges.
