# Collab_Reposit
The place to discuss plans and share ideas for the game.

## HALO Labyrinth Scripture
See [HALO_Scripture.md](HALO_Scripture.md) for the cross-referential field guide that outlines the HALO system, identity triad (Solaris/Lirael/Morgana), synchronicity ledger rules, and the patron/Dragon Hydra overlays used for the project.

## Playable prototype
- Open `index.html` to try the browser prototype. It now includes a monetizable **Labyrinth Run** loop with banked coins, daily challenges, supporter-mode bonuses (Ko‑Fi tip unlock), simulated ad rewards, and a premium Sigil Booster pack (+15 ◎ upfront and +1 ◎ per room). Use it alongside the scripture to turn readings into a playable rogue-divination game.
